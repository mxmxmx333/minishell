To Dos:

Bash Behavior Notes:
Lexing:
-> $((Arithmetic expression)):
	Is going to expand to the result of the arithmetic expression
$((1 - a4 + 5))	= 6 (a4 is treated as a 0) (as well as a4a, a4a4)
$((1 - 5/ a1))	= bash: 1 - 5/ a1: division by 0 (error token is "a1") (bash exited with exit code 1)
$((a - 4a + 5))	= bash: 1 -4a: value too great for base (error token is "4a") (as well as for 4a4a...)

	

-> Inside "$USER ..." (doubles) variable is going to expand
-> Inside 'USER ... ' (singles) variable is not(!) going to expand
here_doc:
-> At reading from here_doc: if "LIMITER" (double quotation marks) inside the here_doc variables do not expand!
-> 


Input: 
-> Input redirection seems to overwrite an existing pipe
