Bash Behavior Notes:
Lexing:
-> $((Arithmetic expression)):
	Is going to expand to the result of the arithmetic expression
$((1 - a4 + 5))	= 6 (a4 is treated as a 0) (as well as a4a, a4a4)
$((1 - 5/ a1))	= bash: 1 - 5/ a1: division by 0 (error token is "a1") (bash exited with exit code 1)
$((a - 4a + 5))	= bash: 1 -4a: value too great for base (error token is "4a") (as well as for 4a4a...)

	

-> Inside "$USER ..." (doubles) variable is going to expand
-> Inside 'USER ... ' (singles) variable is not(!) going to expand
here_doc:
-> At reading from here_doc: if "LIMITER" (double quotation marks) inside the here_doc variables do not expand!
-> 


Input: 
-> Input redirection seems to overwrite an existing pipe


Libft updates:
added:
-> ft_free
-> ft_strndup
-> is_white(char c)

current commit: 

Made architecture decision: 
Tokenizer will launch its own child and the child will handle errors and syntax errors and exit with that code. 
This has positive effect in terms of how erros can be handled in the tokenizer, since it doesnt have to check anymore. On error tokenizer can now exit at anytime. 
-> Effect: Syntax Error function has been changed. msh_error function is obsolete and can be deleted. 

Expander: It somehow has to expand two time. One time the stuff without the quotes, one time with the quotes in this order. 
before adding the quotes, it needs to split everything in multiple words.
